- Fixed the `normalize_filename` function in `sutils.py` to handle byte-type filenames. This resolved a TypeError when checking characters against valid filename characters.
- Resolved an issue in the `getTVDB` function where a byte-like object was passed to a regular expression search. Added decoding to ensure the name variable is a string.
